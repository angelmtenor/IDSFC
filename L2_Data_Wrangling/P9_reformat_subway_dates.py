        2) if hour is 01, your code should return 1

    The dates in our weather underground data are formatted year-month-day.

    the same way.  Write a function that takes as its input a date in the MTA Subway
    data format, and returns a date in the weather underground format.

    Hint: 
    There are a couple of useful functions in the datetime library that will
    help on this assignment, called strptime and strftime.
